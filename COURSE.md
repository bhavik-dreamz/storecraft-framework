# Building a Theme-Based Next.js Framework for Shopify Headless Stores

## 🎯 Course Overview

This comprehensive course will teach you how to build **StoreCraft Framework** - a theme-based framework on top of Next.js for building Shopify headless storefronts. Think of it as "WordPress for Shopify stores" where non-developers can install, switch themes, and build stores without deep Next.js knowledge.

### 🔧 What We'll Build

- **Framework Core**: A Node.js module with predefined routes, React providers, and Shopify integration
- **Theme System**: WordPress-like theme management with fallback routing
- **CLI Tool**: Custom commands that abstract Next.js complexity
- **Next.js Plugin**: Route merging and theme loading system
- **Admin Dashboard**: Built-in admin interface for store management

- Publishing to NPM

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:

1. **Master Framework Architecture**: Understand how to extend existing frameworks like Next.js
2. **Build Theme Systems**: Create WordPress-style theme management systems
3. **Develop CLI Tools**: Build custom command-line interfaces for developers
4. **Integrate APIs**: Connect Shopify's headless API with React applications
5. **Create Abstractions**: Hide complexity while maintaining flexibility
6. **Publish Packages**: Distribute your framework via NPM

## 🔨 Tools & Technologies

- **Core**: Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js 15+
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CVA (Class Variance Authority)
- **API**: GraphQL (Shopify Storefront API)
- **CLI**: Commander.js, Inquirer.js
- **Testing**: Jest, Testing Library
- **Build**: Rollup, SWC
